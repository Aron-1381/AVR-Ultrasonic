# AVR-Ultrasonic
This is an example code of reading a HC-SR04-5 Ultrasonic Sensor Using ATmega16A in 16MHz Clock
It based on Rising edge and falling edge Interrupts of Echo pin, the microcontroller measures the time between these two edges using timer, then returns the amount of pulses and the distance.
